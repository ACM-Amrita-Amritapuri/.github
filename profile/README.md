# ACM Student Chapter

Welcome to the ACM Student Chapter of Amrita at Amritapuri Campus! 

Prepare to unleash your creativity, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and discover potential opportunities to grow personally and professionally.



##  About Us
We are a group of individuals who work on a common ground; technology and innovation!

As a part of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), our mission is to create a spirited space where students can excel in their interested domains.


## What We Do
- Mentorship: We believe that a culture of "students helping students" fosters a welcoming and encouraging environment within theÂ ACM community on campus. Students of all backgrounds and different levels of experience can learn the basics of computer programming in a team setting.

- Projects and Research: ACM encourages members to participate in projects and research initiatives. 

- Technical Workshops and Presentations: ACM frequently arranges workshops and training sessions that cover a wide range of topics in computer science, including programming languages, data structures, software development techniques, and cybersecurity. These events are organized to help members enhance their technical expertise and knowledge.

- Coding Competitions and Hackathons: ACM arranges coding contests and hackathons for members to exhibit their programming expertise and problem-solving abilities.

- Networking and Career Development: ACM creates opportunities for students to connect with professionals in their field of interest, enabling them to explore career options, internships, and research opportunities.
